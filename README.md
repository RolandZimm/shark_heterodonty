# shark_heterodonty

This repository contains data used in the ongoing research project on shark heterodonty
Here, I share the following base data sets:

1. shark tooth half-outlines from 51 species, extracted from toothrows downloaded in 06-2021 from the j-elasmo data collection
   (http://naka.na.coocan.jp/) created and updated by Fumio Nakagawa. The folders containing outline data are named after the respective species, U/L for upper/lower jaw and numbers for relative individual tooth positions.
3. ecological data compiled about the species and their references.
4. NCBI genetic sequence references to create a phylogenetic tree of those species.
5. The Newark format of the used phylogenetic tree.
6. quantitative measurements and compiled ecological trait data for all species in a single plottable file.
7. CCA correlation strengths of complexity descriptors for different ecological traits:

These files relate to research results published as:
Zimm, Roland, Vitoria Tobias-Santos, and Nicolas Goudemand. "Integration of multi-level dental diversity links macro-evolutionary patterns to ecological strategies across sharks." bioRxiv (2024): 2024-10.
eventually to be published elsewhere attending peer review.

Any public use of this data shall include citation of this work as well as the j-elasmo morphological database.
